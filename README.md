# S4_SpahxPack
Collection of the Sphax texture pack patches for the S4 server custom modpack

# Tree Structure
64x folder contains patches which match exactly the 64x format, in the root folder instead I placed all the patches which A- Don't have a 64x resolution zip or B- Patches which have multiple version of it (eg. Static vs Animated Ores).

To properly "compile" the S4_SphaxPack ones need to download the 64x folder AND add the non-64x patches missing AND choose a version to add from multiple version patches.
