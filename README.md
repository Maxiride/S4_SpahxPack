# S4_SpahxPack
Collection of the Sphax texture pack patches for the S4 server custom modpack

# Tree Structure
64x folder contains patches which match exactly the 64x format, in the root folder instead I placed all the patches which A- Don't have a 64x resolution zip or B- Patches which have multiple version of it (eg. Static vs Animated Ores).

To properly "compile" the S4_SphaxPack ones need to download the 64x folder AND add the non-64x patches missing AND choose a version to add from multiple version patches.


# Credits
All credits goes to http://bdcraft.net/, to the original vanilla sphax pack and to all the other designers who made the patches you see in this repo. I _DO_NOT_ own\made any of this contnent. The only purpose of this repo is to track down and easily organize all the patches need for the S4 server, more infos here http://www.s4pack.com/
